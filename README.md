The German Shepperd App

The app that I created is called the German shepherd app. This app is a game and it basically about making the dog is happy, making the dog to eat when its hungry and to make the dog to play. The game is about teaching people about how to take care of the dog, what dogs need for them to be able to grow and what entertainment you can do with your dog.
The game has a welcome for people to see be able start the game and it shows a huge background picture for the german sheperd and it has a startup button for everyone to be able to begin the game. How I created the introduction for the game is that I firstly created a new project and chose empty views activity and named it the app. The empty view activity will give me two activities. One is called the activity main and main activity. In activity main is where I created the design for my game and the design consist of background image which is the dog displayed in the app. I used image view for background image. The I used button for me to be able to have a startup button. I then constrained the button for all sides. Then went to main main activity where I have to declare my button had create Val for startup button and set on listener for my button for the startup button for my button to be able to work. The other codes are used for the app to able to make the buttons to work as they will be displayed on the video.
I also added another main activity where the game will be mostly played at. The main part of the game. I started by creating the same back ground image for the game. This time on this activity I made three buttons. One is used to feed the dog, to clean the dog and to play the dog. I used images to display the dog actions so that for if someone chose to feed the dog and that it would display the picture of the dog eating. This time I added a progress bar to show the dog progress in the activities that it doing in the game. I used for images for the game. Each of the images are about what the buttons instructing you about. The hunger, happy and clean words displayed under buttons, I used text view for them in the design for my game to display the text. The progress bars next to those texts is used to show if the dog is full or not when its happy are not, if it cleaned enough or not. So, if the progress bar is not full, the dog is either not fully happy, cleaned stuff or feed depending on the button that you chose. So, to make it full you have to press the button a lot until you see the progress bar get full. The play button is to make the dog happy; the clean button is used to make the dog clean; the feed button is used to make the dog full. If you press each button, you will notice that the pictures of the dog changes as you press the feed button it will show the picture of the dog eating and so on.
The codes I used are that I used the same codes to make the buttons work for three as I explained at first for the beginning of the game. I used val for all the things I used for game display. I updated images for the pet to match action icon for all the images of the pet. Set on images of the pet on the second screen. I also declared for the progress bar to also make it work and codes.

I used GitHub to put my game app there and it will be able to show details of the game app and how did I create this I. firstly I pushed and commit my app to GitHub by android studio. Make sure that your emulator is running for app to work. Then it will display all the file of the app that I created. I also added a read me file where it will display this essay regarding the app creation purpose and the utilization of GitHub. I made my file in GitHub public for people to see details of the app.There is a link of the video that I made that will show the example of the game and  explain how I created the game .
